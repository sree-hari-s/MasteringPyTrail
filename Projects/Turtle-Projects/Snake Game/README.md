# Snake Game

## Overview

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game in which players control a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective is to maneuver the snake, avoid collisions with walls and itself, and eat as much food as possible to score points.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:**
  - Players control the snake's movement using arrow keys or WASD keys to navigate the game grid.

- **Food Generation:**
  - The game randomly generates food on the grid for the snake to eat and grow.

- **Scoring System:**
  - Points are awarded to the player each time the snake eats food.

- **Collision Detection:**
  - The game checks for collisions between the snake, walls, and food, ending the game if a collision occurs.

- **Game Over:**
  - The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
