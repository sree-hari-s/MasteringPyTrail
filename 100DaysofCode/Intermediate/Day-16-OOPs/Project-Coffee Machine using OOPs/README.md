# Coffee Machine Program

This Coffee Machine Program simulates a coffee vending machine with the following features:

1. **User Prompt:**
   - Users are prompted with the question, "What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino/):"
   - The prompt shows every time an action has completed, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. **Turn Off:**
   - To turn off the Coffee Machine, the user can enter "off" as a secret word.
   - The code execution ends when "off" is entered, allowing maintainers to shut down the machine.

3. **Print Report:**
   - Users can enter "report" to generate a report showing the current resource values, including water, milk, coffee, and money.

4. **Check Resources:**
   - The program checks if there are enough resources to make the selected drink.
   - If resources are insufficient (e.g., not enough water), an error message is displayed.

5. **Process Coins:**
   - If resources are sufficient, the user is prompted to insert coins.
   - The program calculates the monetary value of the coins inserted based on quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

6. **Check Transaction:**
   - The program verifies if the user has inserted enough money to purchase the selected drink.
   - If the money is insufficient, the program refunds the money.
   - If the money is more than the drink cost, the program offers change.

7. **Make Coffee:**
   - If the transaction is successful and there are enough resources, the program deducts the ingredients needed to make the drink.
   - The user is served their selected drink with a message, "Here is your drink. Enjoy!"

The Coffee Machine Program provides an interactive and realistic coffee vending experience, ensuring that users can enjoy their favorite coffee beverages.
