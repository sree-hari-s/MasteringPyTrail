# 100 Movies that You Must Watch

## Objective

Scrape the top 100 movies of all time from a website. Generate a text file called `movies.txt` that lists the movie titles in ascending order (starting from 1).
The result should look something like this:

```markdown
1) The Godfather
2) The Empire Strikes Back
3) The Dark Knight
4) The Shawshank Redemption
... and so on
```

The central idea behind this project is to be able to use BeautifulSoup to obtain some data - like movie titles - from a website like Empire's (or from, say Timeout or Stacker that have curated similar lists).

### ⚠️ Important: Use the Internet Archive's URL

Since websites change very frequently, **use this link**

```link
URL = "https://web.archive.org/web/20200518073855/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/"
```
